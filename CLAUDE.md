# CLAUDE.md — caveman log

Ship burn fuel. Fast ship eat much fuel. Slow ship save fuel.

## RULES (always follow)
- One phase at time. No sprawl. No extra stuff.
- Read this file first. Do what phase say.
- Test before say done.
- Docstring in English. Explain physics.
- Commit small. Push when told.

## PHYSICS (remember)
- Power ~ V^3. Drag ~ V^2, power = drag * V.
- Daily fuel ~ V^3.
- Voyage fuel fixed distance ~ V^2 (less days when fast).

## PHASES
- [x] Phase 1 — backend fuel model + test. DONE. checks passed.
      - backend/fuel_model.py (daily_fuel, voyage_fuel)
      - backend/test_fuel.py (table: 16/14/12.6 kn, 2000 nm)
      - .gitignore, README.md
      - run output good: 16kn cost +30.6%, 12.6kn save 19%.
- [ ] Phase 2 — NEXT. (define when start)
